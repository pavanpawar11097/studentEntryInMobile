# studententrymobileapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **local database system in Flutter** using SQLite (`sqflite`) and `path_provider`.  
It is designed as a learning resource for students or developers to understand **CRUD operations**, local data persistence, and Flutter UI integration.

Key learning objectives:

- Understanding **SQLite database integration** in Flutter applications  
- Implementing **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations  
- Using **dialogs** (`AlertDialog`) for data entry and editing  
- Managing **state updates** and refreshing UI after database operations  
- Handling **platform-specific file paths** for storing data locally  
- ➕ Add Student Details  
- 📄 View Student List  
- ✏️ Update Student Information  
- ❌ Delete Student Entry  

| Feature | Description |
|--------|------------|
| SQLite Database | Uses `sqflite_common_ffi` for storing data locally |
| CRUD Operations | Add, Edit, Delete, and Retrieve student records |
| Dialog Based UI | Uses `AlertDialog` for adding and editing entries |
| Cross-Platform | Works on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows & Linux |

## 📦 Packages Used

| Package | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `sqflite` | SQLite database handler (desktop/mobile support) |
| `path_provider` | Getting application directory |
| `flutter/material.dart` | UI toolkit |

This app can serve as a practical lecture example for **mobile and desktop Flutter development** involving persistent local data storage.
